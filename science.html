    <h2>The Science Behind J1407b</h2>
    <p>J1407b is an exoplanet with a massive ring system that challenges what we know about planets and moons.</p>

    <h3>Key Facts</h3>
    <div class="facts">
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Discovery</h4>
        <p>J1407b was discovered in 2012 by observing changes in the brightness of its star, J1407, located in the constellation Centaurus.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Ring System</h4>
        <p>Its rings span approximately 120 million kilometers in diameter – about 200 times larger than Saturn's rings.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Mass</h4>
        <p>Estimated to be 10–40 times more massive than Jupiter, placing it between a giant planet and a brown dwarf.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Distance</h4>
        <p>Located around 420 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Centaurus.</p>

      <h3>How Was It Discovered?</h3>
      <p>
        J1407b was detected through the transit method – astronomers noticed unusual, long-lasting dips in the brightness
        of its host star, J1407. Between April and May 2007, the star's light dimmed in a complex pattern lasting 56 days.
        This unprecedented eclipse revealed a massive ring system passing in front of the star.
      </p>
      <p>
        The discovery was made by analyzing data from the SuperWASP project, an international collaboration searching for
        exoplanets. The distinctive light curve showed multiple dips and variations, suggesting not just one ring, but a
        complex system of at least 30 rings with gaps between them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="info-section">
      <h3>The Ring System</h3>
      <p>
        J1407b's ring system is truly extraordinary. If we replaced Saturn's rings with J1407b's, they would be easily
        visible from Earth and would appear several times larger than the full Moon in our night sky.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Ring Statistics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diameter: ~120 million km (0.8 AU)</li>
          <li>Number of rings: At least 30 detected</li>
          <li>Mass: Equivalent to Earth's mass</li>
          <li>Gaps: Several prominent gaps suggesting moon formation</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>
        One particularly large gap in the rings, located at about 0.4 AU from the planet, may contain a moon nearly as
        large as Earth. This gap is similar to how Saturn's moon Titan clears material from its orbital path.

    <section class="info-section">
      <h3>Is It a Planet or a Brown Dwarf?</h3>
      <p>
        J1407b exists in an interesting gray area. With a mass estimated between 10 and 40 Jupiter masses, it could be
        either a very massive gas giant planet or a small brown dwarf – objects sometimes called "failed stars" because
        they're too small to sustain hydrogen fusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction matters scientifically, but either way, J1407b represents an extreme example of ringed worlds.
        Its classification depends on how it formed: if it formed like a planet from a disk around its star, it's a planet;
        if it formed like a star from collapsing gas, it's a brown dwarf.
      </p>

    <section class="info-section">
      <h3>Why It's Important</h3>
      <p>
        J1407b provides scientists with a unique laboratory for understanding planetary formation. The ring system likely
        represents a snapshot of what Saturn may have looked like billions of years ago, before its moons formed from
        material in its rings.
      </p>
      <p>
        By studying J1407b, astronomers can test theories about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>How large moons form around gas giants</li>
        <li>The evolution of ring systems over time</li>
        <li>The maximum size ring systems can achieve</li>
        <li>The relationship between rings, gaps, and moon formation</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

      <h3>Future Observations</h3>
      <p>
        The next transit of J1407b in front of its star isn't expected until around 2027, as the planet has an orbital
        period estimated between 10 and 20 years. When it does transit again, astronomers will be ready with more advanced
        telescopes and instruments to capture even more detailed data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future observations may reveal more about the ring structure, detect additional moons forming in the gaps, and
        help determine whether J1407b is truly a planet or a brown dwarf. This mysterious world continues to captivate
        scientists and challenge our understanding of planetary systems.
